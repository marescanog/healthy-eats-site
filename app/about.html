                            <p>Once upon a time, there was a feisty, little girl who loved to cook healthy meals for people that she loved.  She made sure that her meals are <strong>delicious and nourishing</strong>, with the goal of maintaining vitality and health.  This little girl grew up with years of experience in preparing delicious healthy meals.  Her name is Lily.</p>
                            <p>Holidays are festive with Lily making wonderfully tasty dishes being served to friends and family.  One family friend made a comment about wishing that healthy, delicious meals would be available every day, all year round, and with a minimum of fuss. <strong>A business idea was born</strong> and Lily founded healthy eats.</p>
                            <p>A typical day in Lola Lilyâ€™s life starts very early in the morning.  She looks over all the marketing purchases, making sure that <strong>everything is fresh and the best in quality</strong>.  Still innovative, Lola Lily is open to new ideas from her kitchen staff down to the delivery people.</p>
